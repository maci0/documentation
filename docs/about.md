# About

This idea of this project is to explore the idea of building `Kubernetes` clusters using heterogeneous hardware, such as a combination of classical `X86/AMD64` servers, and low consumption `RISC-V` boards. With this project, we want to learn more about the internal of `Linux` itself, but also benchmark the performance of both CPU architectures. This project was created for educational purpose, but may also serve as a proof of concept for future works.

This project will present step-by-step guides, for each milestone of our original goal : **building a Kubernetes cluster with mixed RISC-V and X86 nodes**.
